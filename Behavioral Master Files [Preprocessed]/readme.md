3 preprocessed files are outputted from R scripts: 
<br>
MLINDIV_behavioral_full.csv, MLINDIV_trial_full.csv, MLINDIV_participant_full.csv

The scripts are located in /mnt/chrastil/lab/users/rob/scripts/MLINDIV/ and are called:
<br>
Explore_MLINDIV.R, trial_full.R, path_distances.R, participant_full.R

The csv files are located in 2 folders:
<br>
(1) /mnt/chrastil/lab/data/MLINDIV/raw/raw_behav/ 
<br>
(2) /mnt/chrastil/lab/data/MLINDIV/preprocessed/behavioral/ 

It is recommended to make a copy of the files from the latter folder (/preprocessed/behavioral) for personal use.

In the participant full file,
<br>
ts = trial standard deviation
<br>
tm = trial mean
<br>
es = explore standard deviation
<br>
em = explore mean
